//THE O IN SOLID STANDS FOR THE OPEN CLOSED PRINCIPLE
//THE class files in this package/folder will demonstrate an example showing a violation of this principle.
//The open principle states
//"software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification"
//Which means that we should avoid writing classes that need to be modified every time there is a new requirement. Instead we should be writing classes/interfaces that can be extended.
